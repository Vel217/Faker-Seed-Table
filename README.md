## A project to randomize fake user data in the form of a table.
The project was created in React. There is internationalization, and 3 languages are supported (data generation also depends on the locale). It is possible to generate random errors (emulation of incorrect data input by users.) for each entry (the number of errors is adjusted by the slider from 0 to 1000 for each entry). The table supports infinite scrolling.
There is also a seed value that can be controlled with a slider (when entering the same seed values, identical sequences of fake user data are displayed)
